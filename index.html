        My effective team management skills enable me to lead cross-functional digital teams to achieve marketing goals. I am skilled in data analysis, data visualization and proficient in using tools such as Google Analytics, Google Data Studio and Google Tag Manager, which enables me to identify key insights and trends that inform and optimize marketing strategy. My experience in website design and front-end development also allows me to guide UX strategy and shape wonderful user experiences.

        I am well-versed in Salesforce CRM, Salesforce Marketing Cloud and Pardot, and have experience with product configuration such as automations and workflows. Additionally, I am responsible for social media administration, including Meta Business Suite and YouTube Creator Studio.
